# MoM-Wasserstein
Source code of the AISTATS 2021  Paper: "When OT meets MoM: a robust estimation of the Wasserstein distance".


This code is composed of two part:

-MoM_Wasserstein is the introduced estimator computing the distance between two empirical distributions (i.e., two datasets).

-MoM_WGAN is the Medians-of-Means based WGAN code to reproduce the Section 4.3 of the paper. Bash are given (you need to change the paths inside) for ease of use.
